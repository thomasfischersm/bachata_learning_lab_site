  <div class="default-title">What is a Learning Lab?</div>
  <div class="default-body">A Learning Lab is a unique learning experience that pairs students with asymmetric skill levels, a more beginning student with a more advanced student. The advanced student will guide the beginner through a specific mini-lesson, providing hands-on instruction and feedback. Unlike traditional group classes that spend a lot of time on demonstrations and explanations, a Learning Lab offers personalized instruction in an one-on-one setting, allowing you to progress at your own pace and tailor the mini-lessons to your needs and interests. Plus, the act of teaching helps deepen your understanding of the material and boost your self-esteem. Say goodbye to frustration and hello to a more exciting and engaging way to learn.</div>

  <div class="default-title">Sensual Bachata</div>
  <div class="default-body">Sensual Bachata is a sensual and intimate dance style that combines traditional bachata's intricate footwork and salsa's turn patterns. It's characterized by its sensual and fluid movements, also known as corporal movements, that are led in an improvised way. This allows for a wide range of expression and improvisation, making it a unique and personal experience. The connection between partners and the music is also emphasized, which makes it an exhilarating and empowering experience. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced dancer, Sensual Bachata is a perfect way to express yourself, let go and immerse yourself in the moment. Join a Sensual Bachata learning lab today and discover the beauty and passion of this dance style.</div>

Instead of just learning pre-determined steps, our classes focus on developing your movement technique and motor function. This approach will help you create a strong foundation for your dance skills, making your movements look elegant and effortless, instead of clunky and unrefined. Good body movement in dance is characterized by fluidity, grace, and control, which is achieved through our focus on movement technique, rather than just memorizing choreography.
